            Once upon a time, in a region that is now known as the state of Haryana, lived a tribe known as the Bharatas. During this period, an alliance of ten kingdoms to the west of the Bharatas plotted an invasion. However, the Bharatas were a resolute force and successfully repelled the attack.

            Rather than proclaiming their own deity as the supreme power—despite their clear victory—the Bharatas chose a different path. They extended an invitation to both the defeated tribes and those who had remained neutral. The Bharatas proposed a revolutionary idea: every deity deserved a place of honor near the sacred fire, and all gods would be mutually respected. Those who accepted this pact would henceforth commit to honoring the deities of others, thereby fostering a society built on inclusion and tolerance.

            This concept gained widespread acceptance and came to be known as "Bharat." Eventually, the pact solidified into a social contract that defined the ethos of the Indic Civilization. Any tribe willing to adhere to these principles adopted the identity of "Bharatiya."
